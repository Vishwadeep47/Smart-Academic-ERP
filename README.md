# Smart-Academic-ERP

🌍Context:
Educational institutions often deal with fragmented systems for attendance, academics, communication, and admin tasks—resulting in inefficiency, fraud, and disengaged students.

🧠Challenge:
Develop a mobile-first Academic ERP that integrates key campus functions into one smart system. Features should include tamper-proof face recognition–based attendance, grade tracking, assignment submissions & exam registration, real-time alerts for schedules, results, deadlines, and changes, leave requests, fee payments, fine tracking, and library management, and personalized dashboards for students, faculty, and admins.

🎯Goal:
To streamline academic and administrative processes through automation and real-time updates—enhancing transparency, efficiency, and student engagement across the campus.
